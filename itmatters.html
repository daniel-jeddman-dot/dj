  <h3>It matters</h3>
  <p>Show me your way, that I may walk with you. The cry of my life is to love you more. To live a life that is pleasing
    and pleasant to life. Give me a second chance to prove you right. I know you really understand all I am trying
    to say by now. I've counted on trees and waters. <img src="https://urbangospeltunez.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/img-20190913-wa0076-1711491618.jpg" alt="Daniel Jeddman Music">They never gave me any answers. My heart desired for the size of time.
    But time and life proved me wrong. There comes a stranger, from the highlands of heaven, his eyes like flames of fire.
    Why has though departed from thy glory given to you with no pain. I may be a stranger but my words are mightier. Believe in
    me and believe in my words.</p>
